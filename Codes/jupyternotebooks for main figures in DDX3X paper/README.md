1. DDX3X_Random_Forest_model.ipynb 

This describes the generation of a random forest model based on the Log-fold-change values across multiple days of DDX3X saturation genome editing data to classify variants according to their relevance for DDX3X-associated neurodevelopment disorder

2. A Jupyter notebook is provided for each data Figure shown in the manuscript. Data from the supplementary tables available with the manuscript can be used together with this code to regenerate each table shown in the paper.
