# Extraction of gDNA from cell pellets

## Material
Qiagen DNEasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, 69504)   </br>
RNAse A (20mg/mL, PureLink RNase A, Life Technology, 12091021) </br>
TE buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH8, 1mM EDTA) </br>
HAP1 cell pellet


## Protocol
1. Make sure each sample is maximum 10m HAP1 cells. If necessary, re-suspend pellet in DPBS(-/-) and remove 10m cells/100ul DPBS. 
2. Resuspend pellet in 400µl TE buffer (Or if cells are in 100µl PBS, add 300µl TE buffer to the sample)
3. Add 10µl RNAse A
4. Incubate at 37 C for 15 minutes
5. Add 40µl Proteinase K
6. Add 400µl Buffer AL. Mix thoroughly.
7. Incubate at 56 C for 15 minutes
8. Add 400µl Ethanol (80-100%). Mix thoroughly
9. Mix the mixture by pipetting up and down for 5 times. Pipet 700uL of the mixture into one DNEasy Mini spin column placed in a 2ml collection tube. Centrifuge at 9500 rpm for 1 minute. 
10.	Discard the flow-through add the rest of the lysate to the same column. Centrifuge at 9500 rpm for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and the collection tube.
11.	Place the spin column in a new collection tube. Add 500µl Buffer AW1. Centrifuge at 9500 rpm for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and the collection tube.
12.	Place the spin column in a new collection tube. Add 500µl Buffer AW2. Centrifuge at 13 200 rpm for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through. 
13. Centrifuge another 2 minutes at 13 200 rpm. Discard the flow-through and the collection tube.
14. Place the spin column into a new 1.5ml tube.
15. To avoid ethanol contamination of the extracted gDNA, clear all remaining wash buffer from the o-ring of the spin column using a p200 pipette.
16. Elute the DNA by adding 100µl Buffer AE to the center of the spin column membrane. 
17. Incubate at room temperature for >5 minute.  
18. Centrifuge at 13 200 rpm for 1 minute.
19. Measure concentration of sample using Nanodrop.
