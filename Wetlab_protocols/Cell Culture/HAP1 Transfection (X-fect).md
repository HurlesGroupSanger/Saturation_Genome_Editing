# HAP1 Transfection Protocol (Xfect)

## Material
1) X-fect (Takara 6316318)
2) Maxi-prep plasmid
3) Seeded HAP1 cell in 12-well plate
4) HAP1 medium

## Protocol

### <ins> Day -1 </ins>
Seed 800K cell per well of 12-well plate. 

Aim to have 80% confluent, well distributed cells for transfection the next day.

### <ins> Day 0 </ins>
1)	Change fresh medium (IMDM+10%FBS) without antibiotic at least 1hr before transfection.
2)	For each well, use 6ug of plasmid (eg. 2ug sgRNA plasmid + 4ug HDR Lib) and add the x-fect buffer to total volume of 100uL, then add 3.6uL X-fect, incubate 10min RT.
3)	Add 100uL of the transfection mix to each well after 10min incubation.
4)	Change fresh medium (IMDM+10%FBS) without antibiotic after 4hr of transfection.

### For puro+ plasmid transfection
### <ins> Day 1 </ins>
Change fresh medium (IMDM+10%FBS) with 3ug/mL puro (and 10ug/mL Blast, if this is the Cas9+ HAP1 cell) after 24hr of transfection.

### <ins> Day 2 </ins>
Change fresh medium (IMDM+10%FBS) with 3ug/mL puro (and 10ug/mL Blast, if this is the Cas9+ HAP1 cell) after 24hr of transfection.

### <ins> Day 3 </ins>
Passage the 12-well plate to 2x T150 flasks.
1)	Remove the medium.
2)	Wash with 1 mL of PBS each well.
3)	Add 250uL TrypLE express to each well.
4)	Incubate at 37C for 4 min.
5)	Add 1mL medium (no blast, no puro) per well for inactivation.
6)	Wash plate with 6mL medium.
7)	Cell count
8)	Seed 10m cells to each T150. Use 30ml medium (IMDM+10%FBS) supplemented with 10ug/mL Blast per flask.

### <ins> Day 4 </ins>
Harvest one T150 (Day 4 sample).

### <ins> Day 5 onwards </ins>
Passage T150 flasks every other day until the final screen timepoint. Use 30-40ml media (IMDM+10%FBS) per flask. 
Harvest cell pellets on day 5, 7, 11, 15 and 21.
