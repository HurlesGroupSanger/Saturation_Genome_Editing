# GFP transfection by Neon electroporation in Hap1 cells

### Material
HAP1 cells (Clone A5, Cas9+ Lig4-) </br>
HAP1 media (IMDM + 10% FBS) w/o antibiotics (IMDM (Life Tech, 12440053 or 21980065), Heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, 10500-064)) </br>
TrypLE Express (Gibco, 12604013) </br>
PBS(-/-) </br>
Neon™ Transfection System incl. Neon Pipette </br>
Neon Electroporation Kit (100ul): tips, Neon tubes, buffer R, buffer E2 (Invitrogen, MPK10096 or MPK10025) </br>
GFP plasmid </br>
Sterile 1.5ml tubes </br>

### Protocol - Cell preparation
1.	Wash cells with PBS(-/-)
2.	Add trypLE to labware and incubate for 3 minutes at 37C
3.	Collect cells in Hap1 media (no antibiotics)
4.	Count cells
5.	Transfer the required number of cells to a falcon tube (ie 1.2m cells/well in a 6wp*) 
6.	Centrifuge 200rcf for 3 minutes
7.	Aspirate media and re-suspend cell pellet in 5ml of PBS(-/-)
8.	Centrifuge 200rcf for 3 minutes
9.	Aspirate PBS and re-suspend cells in appropriate volume of buffer R (ie 120ul per reaction for 6wp*)
10.	Transfer 120ul cell suspension to a sterile 1.5ml tube
11.	Add required amount of plasmid (eg. use 6ug pMAX GFP per 100ul reaction)
12.	Carefully pipette cell suspension to mix using a p200 pipette (do NOT mix with Neon pipette)

### Protocol - electroporation (refer to Neon user manual for additional instructions on how to operate system)
13.	Set up the pipetting station inside the hood and turn on the computer unit.
14.	Add 3ml of Buffer E2 to the Neon tube and insert into the Electroporation station. You should hear a click when it’s correctly in place.
15.	Prepare the new cell culture plate/labware by adding media (ie 2ml media/well in a 6wp)
16.	Attach tip to Neon pipette while pressing the plunger fully down. Make sure there is no gap between the tip and the pipette.
17.	Carefully pipette the reaction mix up. Important: Make sure there are no bubbles in the pipette tip, or the electroporation will not work!
18.	Transfer the pipette to the electroporation station. You should hear a click when it’s correctly in place.
19.	Set up the correct electroporation settings on the computer unit and press start. (1600 Voltage, 1 pulse, 30ms)
20.	After delivering the electric pulse, Complete is displayed on the touchscreen to indicate that electroporation is complete. You can also hear a click noise from the pipette and will see bubbles forming if the electroporation was successful. A visible spark in the E2 buffer means the electroporation did not work.
21.	Carefully remove the Neon pipette from the station. Pipette the electroporated cells into the cell culture plate with media (from step 15) by pressing down to the first stop only.
Each Neon tip can be used for up to 3 electroporations. Each Neon tube with E2 buffer can be used for up to 10 electroporations. Swap tip/buffer between different samples (biological samples/plasmids). To eject a Neon tip, press the plunger the whole way down.
22.	Gently agitate the plate to spread the cells evenly before transferring it to the incubator.
23.	The next day, check transfection efficiency by FACS.


*Each electroporation requires 100ul. Prepare at least 120ul for each reaction to avoid bubbles in the Neon pipette. Make sure you adjust the cell and plasmid amount to take this extra volume into account.


Do not use any antibiotics in the media during the electroporation (pen/strep, blasticidin, etc)
